            <h2 id="one2">BIOGRAPHY</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, in Röcken, Germany, where his father
                    served as a Lutheran pastor. Friedrich's father's death, when he was four years old, was
                    distressing, which he often referred to in his later writings. Soon after, his youngest brother
                    died.</li>
                <li>So, Nietzche grew up in a household of devoutly Christian women, including his mother, grandmother,
                    sister, and aunts. As a young man, he plunged himself into studying the Bible and Christian
                    theology, and his piety, coupled with a meek personality, earned him the nickname “the little
                    pastor.”</li>
                <li> At the end of this period of schooling, Nietzsche, who had earlier shared the Lutheran religion of
                    his family, found that he had ceased to accept Christianity—a view that soon hardened into outright
                    disbelief in any God. </li>
                <li>At any rate, the nascent skeptic stopped studying theology to focus his work completely on philology
                    and transferred to the University of Leipzig to finish his studies. It was during this time that
                    Nietzsche was introduced to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, whose work would greatly
                    influence Nietzsche’s ideas.</li>
                <li> At only the age of 24 (and without having earned a doctorate), Nietzsche showed so much scholarly
                    promise that he was offered a professorship in 1868 to teach philology at the University of Basel in
                    Switzerland.</li>
                <li>In 1870, Nietzsche joined the military and served as a medical orderly in the Prussian army during
                    the Franco-Prussian War. During his service, Nietzsche contracted diphtheria and dysentery, and (as
                    some scholars speculate) syphilis.</li>
                <li>In 1878, Nietzsche began an experimental phase in his writing with Human, All Too Human. The book
                    debuted what would become one of his stylistic trademarks — the use of short, pithy, and sometimes
                    cryptic aphorisms to convey a larger and deeper message.</li>
                <li>Debilitated by lingering pain from his horse injury, as well as diseases he had contracted during
                    the Franco-Prussian War, Nietzsche retired from teaching in 1879 at the age of 35.</li>
                <li>From then until his death he moved around to different villages in Switzerland, France, and Italy in
                    an unsuccessful bid to find a climate more congenial to his health. Through his travels, however, he
                    continued writing and honing his ideas.</li>
                <li>Between bouts of severe sickness and depression in 1883 and 1885, Nietzsche wrote the philosophical
                    novel Thus Spoke Zarathustra, in which he uses the Persian prophet Zarathustra to introduce his
                    famous ideas of the Übermensch (Overman/Superman), eternal recurrence, and the will to power. </li>
                <li>The years between 1886 and 1889 constituted Nietzsche’s most productive and creative period. In
                    1886, he wrote and published perhaps his most famous work (along with Zarathustra) Beyond Good and
                    Evil, in which he exhorted modern philosophers to take on an ethos of creativity, danger, risk, and
                    originality in order to create new values in a world without God.</li>
                <li>The Antichrist, which was published in 1895 was a critique on Christianity (as Nietzsche saw it) in
                    which he argues that the Christian focus on the afterlife was yet another life-denying philosophy,
                    which bred a hatred and denial of the energies and powers of one’s mortal existence.
                </li>
                <li>The interesting thing about The Antichrist is that while Nietzsche attacks Christianity, he has only
                    praise for Jesus Christ himself, positing that “there was only one Christian, and he died on the
                    cross.” </li>
                <li>In 1889, after years of mental and physical issues, Nietzsche suffered a mental collapse in Turin,
                    Italy. The story goes that Nietzsche saw a horse being whipped in the streets, and was moved to
                    overwhelming pity for it. He ran and threw his arms around the horse’s neck to protect it while its
                    tears streamed into his bushy mustache.</li>
                <li> He started signing most of his letters as Dionysus, but sometimes referred to himself as “the
                    crucified one.” His family came to Turin and took him back to Basel where he was hospitalized and
                    later moved in with his mother. He would never write again.</li>
                <li>After 11 years of functionally being a vegetable, Nietzsche finally died in 1900 at the age of 56.
